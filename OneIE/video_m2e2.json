Personally, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even a question.\u201d  \n\nIranian officials have maintained the Boeing 737-800, at an altitude of 2,400 meters, suffered a catastrophic engine failure early Wednesday (local time). All 176 people on board the plane bound for Kyiv died, including 63 Canadians.\n\nBut government sources tell VOA that U.S. officials have examined satellite data and imagery leading them to believe the airliner, just after taking off from Tehran, was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile after being targeted accidentally.\n\n\u201cAt some point they\u2019ll release the black box. Ideally, they\u2019ll get it to Boeing\u201d [the U.S. company that built the 737-800 airliner], added Trump in remarks to reporters in the White House Roosevelt Room on Thursday.\n\nVideo of the aircraft shows it breaking up in the air in a fireball over Iran.\n\nThe crash occurred hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers in response to last week's U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.\n\nThe head of Iran's of Civil Aviation Organization denies the plane could have been hit by a missile.\n\n\u201cScientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane and such rumors are illogical,\" ISNA quoted Ali Abedzadeh as saying.\n\nThe governments of Ukraine and Canada are not accepting the initial assessment by Iran that the cause of the crash appeared to be a mechanical issue.\n\nCanada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, told his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, that many questions will need to be answered, according to the ministry in Ottawa.\n\nInvestigators in Iran said the voice and data recorders from the Boeing 737 aircraft, built in 2016, were recovered from the crash site, a swathe of farmland on the outskirts of the Iranian capital, but that the so-called \u201cblack boxes\u201d were damaged and some data had been lost.\n\n\u201cI hope the Iranians will work with us and provide us with the black box,\u201d U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, said on MSNBC, calling for the Trump administration to grant exemptions to the sanctions law so Boeing investigators from the United States could travel to Iran to cooperate with investigators there.\n\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board typically participates in investigations of overseas air crashes when a U.S. airline or plane manufacturer is involved. But given the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, and the fact that the two sides have no diplomatic relations, it is uncertain whether the NTSB or Boeing would be involved in the investigation of the UIA crash.\n\nIn a statement sent to VOA\u2019s Ukrainian Service, the NTSB said it was \u201cmonitoring developments surrounding the crash of UIA flight 752\u201d and was \u201cfollowing its standard procedures\u201d for international aviation accident investigations.\n\n\u201cAs part of its usual procedures, the NTSB is working with the State Department and other agencies to determine the best course of action,\u201d it said.\n\n\"The U.S. has not participated in an accident investigation in Iran since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. So, it is very unlikely that the NTSB will be involved,\u201d said Madhu Unnikrishnan, editor of U.S. airline news service Skift Airline Weekly in a VOA Ukrainian Service interview.\n\nThe Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which Iran is a signatory, does not require Tehran to hand over the data recorders to the NTSB or Boeing, Andriy Guck, a Ukraine-based attorney and aviation expert, said.\n\n\u201cThere is a duty to investigate,\u201d Guck told VOA\u2019s Ukrainian Service in a phone conversation. \u201cIran can decide to investigate the black boxes by itself or transfer them to a foreign laboratory.

Newsom's budget, which now must be negotiated with the state Legislature by June 15, calls for spending the rainy day fund down over the next three years, starting with roughly $8 billion in the upcoming year. He's also tapping two other reserve funds for another $1 billion.\n\n \n\nThe state would also spend more than $200 million to boost the state's preparations for looming wildfires and other disasters, including hiring another 500 firefighters and 100 support personnel to help make up for the loss of dozens of inmate firefighters who were paroled to ease the risk of coronavirus outbreaks.\n\n", "channel": "VOA News", "duration": "2:18", "topic": "coronavirus"}, "Medical Tents Set up Outside Philadelphia as Possible Coronavirus Screening Facilities": {"id": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heyzZQNdyXs", "long_desc": "CORONAVIRUS:\n\nMedical tents were set up outside Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia as possible future testing stations for the new coronavirus.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNearly 7 million people in the San Francisco area were all but confined to their homes Tuesday in the nation's most sweeping lockdown against the coronavirus, even as spring break crowds partied in Florida and tourists lined up to pose for pictures in front of the world-famous \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign.\n\nArizona, Florida and Illinois pressed ahead with their presidential primaries, recommending such precautions as putting tape on the floor to keep voters a safe distance apart, while Ohio called off its election hours before the polls were to open.\n\nThe official reaction to the crisis varied wildly across the U.S., despite new, more urgent warnings from the Trump administration, which called on Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10 and advised older people to stay home.\n\nCoronavirus infections across the country reached about 6,500, and the death toll climbed to at least 109, with more than half of the victims from Washington state.

In China, Beijing changed the testing criteria multiple times, leading to fluctuating numbers that have made it difficult to determine the outbreak\u2019s growth. Outside China, some countries have reported faulty test kits or long delays in getting results. One large study in China found that more than 80% of the cases are mild, and some infected people show no symptoms. This means the number of infected could be much higher than the official tally.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nLINK: ", "channel": "VOA News", "duration": "1:03", "topic": "protest"}, "Iraq Taking Drastic Measures to Fight Coronavirus Spread": {"id": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQQlRBjQOjQ", "long_desc": "CORONAVIRUS\n\nIraqi civil defense staff disinfected the Kufa Mosque in Najaf, Thursday, February 27, part of the drastic measures the government is taking to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nREAD MORE: Iraq banned all public gatherings and barred entry by travelers from Kuwait and Bahrain, the health minister said on Wednesday, banning travel to or from a total of nine countries as fears grew over the spread of the coronavirus.\n \nIraqi citizens are now banned from traveling to China, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Italy, Bahrain, and Kuwait, Health Minister Jaafar Allawi said in a decree seen by Reuters.\n \nHealth Minister Jaafar Allawi also ordered the suspension of schools and universities, and the closure of cinemas, cafes, clubs, and other public gathering spots nationwide from Feb. 27 to March 7.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nLINK: ", "channel": "VOA News", "duration": "0:38", "topic": "coronavirus"}, "US President Donald Trump Takes New Coronavirus Test, Tests Negative Again": {"id": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_Q0LLUTLM", "long_desc": "U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he tested negative for COVID-19 after taking a second test.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nREAD MORE: Trump announced his test results during a White House briefing.

Each stage of the test prompted loud cheers from SpaceX crew members watching the footage from back on land.\n\nThe test is crucial to qualify the capsule to fly humans to the International Space Station, something the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to come as soon as mid-2020. It follows years of development and delays as the United States has sought to revive its human spaceflight program through private partnerships.\n\nNASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil for the first time since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011. The space agency has since relied on Russian spacecraft for rides to the space station.\n\nDuring the test the Falcon 9 rocket's boosters shut down in a mock failure that triggered Crew Dragon's so-called SuperDraco thrusters to jet itself away at supersonic speeds of up to 2,400 kph.\n\nThe capsule deployed four parachutes to slow its descent to the water, and carried two human-shaped test dummies on seats fitted with motion sensors to collect data on the immense g-force - the effect of acceleration on the body - astronauts would be subjected to during abort.\n\nThe test was originally scheduled for mid-2019 but was delayed after a Crew Dragon capsule exploded in April on a test stand just before firing its launch abort thrusters, triggering a lengthy investigation.\n\nSpaceX-led investigators in July zeroed in on a previously unknown explosive reaction between a titanium valve and a propellant used to ignite the thrusters.
